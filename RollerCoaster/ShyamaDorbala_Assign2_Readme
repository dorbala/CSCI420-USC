  Expected Output

	The Roller Coaster is functional and you move along.
	

	
  Features Incorporated
  -------------
	
	1. Perspective: Two kinds of views are incorporated: 
			a. first person: where you move along with the camera
			b. third person: where you see a logo move along the camera
			The selection is done using the menu function, on right click.

	2. Spline Generation: Catmull Rom splines are rendered using the control matrices and calculating the interleaving points.

	3. Finding u: Recursive subdivision approach was used to pick points in between two control points.

	4. Speed Control: Speed control based on heights has been implemented to control how the roller coaster moves.

	5. Texture Maps: Sky, ground, the crossbars are texture mapped.

	6. Double Rails: A two-rail track is generated using the BiNormals. The method described in the class was used to generate the normals and the binormals.

	7. Rail Cross-section: Each rail is inturn, a set of cuboids.

	8. Support: A naive support of a few cuboidal structures has been given to the coaster
