These are files from my CSCI-420 assignments at USC, Spring'14.

There are two different aspects of Graphics implemented in here:
1. Using Splines in Computer Graphics: Splines are essential tools in the graphics scenes, and they can be used to build complex objects.
									   There are different kinds of splines in OpenGL today, but I've mainly used Catmul-Rom Splines
									   to build a roller coaster, specified in the 'track' file. 
									   
2. Building a Ray Tracer: I'd rather say, a Ray Caster. Its mainly done in C/C++ using the Triangle/Sphere intersection techniques of Math.
